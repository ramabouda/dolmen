--- CSS class ---

default_popover : Popover is setup by default on all html objects with the class 
"default_popover". If an object with this class is added to the page after this
call, you need to make the popover call again.

has_popover : All popovers with this class will be hidden if the users click outside
the popover.

--- Propotyping ---

You can add a HTML object with the class popover-content directly after the object
triggering the popover in order to have it as the content.
